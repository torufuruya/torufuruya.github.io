**Nice to e-meet you!**  
My name is Toru. I am a Software Engineer, iOS Developer, as well as lover of beer. I am a fan of technology and programming. I‚Äôm also loving football, coffee and of course üç£. I'm based in Tokyo now but I'm waiting for requests for work from all over the world!

## Summary

I‚Äôve been working on iOS development for the past three years. I have experience in SDK development as well as application. I‚Äôm comfortable working with both Objective-C and Swift, and I can develop robust application through the unit test and UI test. I've been in Agile development for the past six years. Although small scale, I've experienced the management of the developer team and realized smooth progress.
